#Guess the line

Guess the line is a program developed for your entertainment. With the help of it you can test your knowledge of some of the most well-known songs of the last century (more songs and more levels will be added in the second version).

To set up the program you should have Python 3.5 version. You can open it with the help of command line.

When you start the program, you’ll see a line from the song and the name of the songwriter/singer who made it famous. All you have to do is to type the song’s title. Be careful – you are given only three attempts to enter the right name of the song (of course, you can skip some you don’t know by clicking the Enter button on your keyboard). After completing the whole task, you will be shown your results: the correct name of the song (one by one) and the number of the attempts. Also it will show you your score (“you’ve got n correct out of 10”)

P. S. Dont't judge me. It's my first "big" project :)
